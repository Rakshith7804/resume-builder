# Resume Builder Web Application

I’m excited to showcase our Resume Builder Application, designed to solve real-world problems and address common issues faced by users on existing resume builders.





# What Motivated us to build it:-
- **74%** of job seekers feels confused about what information to include or what to leave out. **(Zety Resume Report, 2023)**
- **68%** of peoples Don't know what recruiters care about most. **(LinkedIn Hiring Insights, 2024)**
- **76%** of resumes are eliminated by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) before reaching a human recruiter, often due to formatting issues or missing keywords.  **(Jobscan ATS Compatibility Report, 2024)**
- **88%** of resumes are rejected because they include a photo, which can introduce unconscious bias. **(TeamStage, 2024)**
- **63%** of recruiters prefer resumes that are customized to the specific job position. **(TeamStage, 2024)**

- Only **2–3%** of resumes result in an interview, emphasizing the need for a well-crafted and tailored resume. **(Prosperity for America, 2025)**


# Well there are existing resume builders that claim to build ATS friendly resumes but..
- **Very less customization option:** Most resume builders use rigid LaTeX-based templates that only provide static PDFs. While LaTeX offers clean formatting, over 95% of users find it hard to understand or customize—forcing them to repeatedly repurchase resumes for minor changes, making the process both frustrating and costly.
- **Low quality and unprofessional template in free tier:** Most popular resume builders offer only basic, low-quality templates in their free tier — often outdated, unprofessional, or lacking modern design elements. Users are then prompted to pay $1–$2 per resume download, even after spending time building it.
- **Frustrating Form Flow:** Most resume builders use a rigid, step-by-step form that hides the full scope of required info. Fields appear one by one, forcing users to keep clicking “Next” without a clear overview—wasting time and causing confusion for those who want to prepare content in advance.
- **Laggy and complex interface:** Many resume builders are slow and laggy, with unresponsive previews—creating friction for users who just want to build or update resumes quickly
- **Data Privacy Concerns:** Most resume builders compromise user privacy by using sensitive data without consent. They often collect personal information and use it for purposes beyond just resume building, including selling it to third parties for targeted ads and other uses.
- **Login and Cookie Hassles:** Many resume builders require users to sign in and manage cookies, leading to unnecessary frustration and security concerns. This not only disrupts the user experience but also exposes personal data to potential risks.
