# Well there are existing resume builders that claim to build ATS friendly resumes but..
- **Very less customization option:** Most resume builders use rigid LaTeX-based templates that only provide static PDFs. While LaTeX offers clean formatting, over 95% of users find it hard to understand or customize‚Äîforcing them to repeatedly repurchase resumes for minor changes, making the process both frustrating and costly.
- **Low quality and unprofessional template in free tier:** Most popular resume builders offer only basic, low-quality templates in their free tier ‚Äî often outdated, unprofessional, or lacking modern design elements. Users are then prompted to pay $1‚Äì$2 per resume download, even after spending time building it.
- **Frustrating Form Flow:** Most resume builders use a rigid, step-by-step form that hides the full scope of required info. Fields appear one by one, forcing users to keep clicking ‚ÄúNext‚Äù without a clear overview‚Äîwasting time and causing confusion for those who want to prepare content in advance.
- **Laggy and complex interface:** Many resume builders are slow and laggy, with unresponsive previews‚Äîcreating friction for users who just want to build or update resumes quickly
- **Data Privacy Concerns:** Most resume builders compromise user privacy by using sensitive data without consent. They often collect personal information and use it for purposes beyond just resume building, including selling it to third parties for targeted ads and other uses.
- **Login and Cookie Hassles:** Many resume builders require users to sign in and manage cookies, leading to unnecessary frustration and security concerns. This not only disrupts the user experience but also exposes personal data to potential risks.
